# Lighter DEX Market Maker

This project is a complete market making solution for the Lighter DEX, built in Python. It consists of four main components that work together to collect data, calculate optimal trading parameters, determine the market trend, and execute a market making strategy.

By default, it uses 25% of available capital per order (configurable via `CAPITAL_USAGE_PERCENT`). It can use leverage (1 by default = no leverage; for example, if your account has 100$ and you set leverage to 2, it will apply 2x leverage and use 25% of the leveraged amount ($200 * 0.25 = $50) per order.

The four core components are:
1.  **Data Collector (`gather_lighter_data.py`)**: Connects to the Lighter DEX websocket to stream real-time order book and trade data, saving it to CSV files.
2.  **Parameter Calculator (`calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py`)**: Implements the Avellaneda-Stoikov model to calculate optimal bid/ask spreads and reservation prices based on the collected data.
3.  **Trend Finder (`find_trend_lighter.py`)**: Uses a Supertrend indicator to determine the current market trend (uptrend or downtrend).
4.  **Market Maker (`market_maker.py`)**: Executes the market making strategy by placing and managing orders on the Lighter exchange, using the parameters generated by the calculator and the trend determined by the trend finder.

The entire system is orchestrated using Docker Compose, making it easy to run and manage.

Important Tips:
- Use on a dedicated account or sub-account. The bot uses 25% of available capital per order by default, and reinvests profits (compound interest).
- You don't need to have the `.env` file to run the data collector service
- Run first the data collector service only for some time, by edtiting the `docker-compose.yml`  (comment out the market maker service)
- To get your `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, you can go to\
   `https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/api/v1/accountsByL1Address?l1_address=0xcEd...` where `0xcEd...` is your L1 (EVM) wallet address (Metamask, Rabby, Ledger, ...)
- Freshly coded, probably some bugs, only run with small amount of funds

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.10+
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation

Before running the bot, you need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1.  **Create `.env` file:** Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. See `.env.example` for a template.

    ```env
    # Lighter Exchange Credentials
    API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_api_key_private_key>
    ACCOUNT_INDEX=<your_account_index>
    API_KEY_INDEX=<your_api_key_index>

    # Market Maker Behavior
    MARKET_SYMBOL=PAXG
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   `API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, `API_KEY_INDEX`: Your Lighter exchange credentials.
    *   `MARKET_SYMBOL`: The market to trade on (e.g., PAXG, BTC, ETH). Defaults to `PAXG`.
    *   `CLOSE_LONG_ON_STARTUP`: (true/false) If true, the bot will attempt to close any existing long position in the specified market on startup. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `REQUIRE_PARAMS`: (true/false) If true, the market maker will *not* place any orders until valid Avellaneda parameters are calculated. If false, it will use a static fallback spread. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `RESTART_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: The market maker service will automatically restart after this many minutes. This helps in reloading parameters and preventing potential memory leaks. Defaults to `5`.
    *   `LEVERAGE`: The amount of leverage to use (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 8). This value multiplies your available capital, allowing for larger position sizes. Defaults to `1` (no leverage). Set to `2` for 2x leverage, `5` for 5x leverage, etc.
    *   `MARGIN_MODE`: The margin mode to use, either `cross` or `isolated`. This is also configured in `docker-compose.yml`. Defaults to `cross`.
    *   `FLIP`: (true/false) If true, the bot will adopt a short-biased strategy, selling first and then buying back. If false, it will follow a long-biased strategy, buying first and then selling. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `CAPITAL_USAGE_PERCENT`: (decimal) The percentage of available capital to use per order. Set in the code as `0.25` (25%). This controls position sizing - with 25%, each order uses a quarter of your available leveraged capital. Lower values = smaller positions, higher values = larger positions.

You can obtain the API credentials from the Lighter exchange.

### Running the Bot

Start all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the following services in the background:
*   `data-collector`: Gathers real-time market data.
*   `avellaneda-calculator`: Calculates optimal spreads and reservation prices.
*   `find-trend`: Determines the market trend using the Supertrend indicator.
*   `market-maker`: Executes the trading strategy.

### Stopping the Bot

To stop all services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Example Output

## How it Works

### 1. Data Collection

The `gather_lighter_data.py` script connects to the Lighter DEX websocket and subscribes to the order book and trade channels for the configured markets (e.g., 'ETH', 'BTC', 'PAXG', 'ASTER'). It saves this data to CSV files in the `lighter_data` directory.

### 2. Parameter Calculation

The `calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py` script is set to run every 2 hours by default (defined in `docker-compose.yml`). Each time it runs, it analyzes the last 4 hours of trade and order book data to calculate the parameters for the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model.

A key input to this model is market volatility (sigma). The script now calculates this using the **GARCH(1,1) model**, which provides a more sophisticated and responsive measure of volatility. If the GARCH model fails to produce a value, or if there are fewer than 10 historical data periods available, the script automatically **falls back to a rolling standard deviation** of log returns to ensure robustness.

The calculated parameters, including the volatility and optimal spreads, are saved to a nicely formatted JSON file (e.g., `avellaneda_parameters_PAXG.json`) in the `params` directory. It needs at least 1-2 days of gathered data to work properly.

### 3. Trend Finding

The `find_trend_lighter.py` script runs periodically to determine the market trend. It uses a Supertrend indicator, a popular technical analysis tool that uses price volatility to determine the trend. The script calculates the Supertrend value based on historical price data and determines if the market is in an uptrend or a downtrend. The result is saved to a JSON file (e.g., `supertrend_params_PAXG.json`) in the `params` directory.

### 4. Market Making

The `market_maker.py` script is the core of the bot. It reads the parameters from the JSON files generated by the calculator and the trend finder. It then connects to the Lighter exchange and places buy and sell orders based on the calculated optimal spreads, reservation prices, and the current market trend.

**Capital Management**: The bot uses a conservative approach to capital allocation. It applies the following formula for each order:
- Available Capital × (1 - Safety Margin) × Leverage × Capital Usage Percent
- Example with default settings: $100 × 0.99 × 1 × 0.25 = $24.75 per order
- Example with 2x leverage: $100 × 0.99 × 2 × 0.25 = $49.50 per order

The bot will adjust its strategy based on the `FLIP` environment variable, allowing it to switch between long-biased and short-biased strategies. It continuously monitors the market and its own orders, adjusting them as needed to maximize profitability.

**⚠️ Risk Warning**: This trading software will likely lose money, even if it generates significant volume, because it isn’t competitive with professional firms. Always start with small amounts and make sure you understand the risks of automated cryptocurrency trading.
