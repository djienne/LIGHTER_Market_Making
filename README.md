# Lighter DEX Market Maker

This project is a complete market making solution for the Lighter DEX, built in Python. It consists of three main components that work together to collect data, calculate optimal trading parameters, and execute a market making strategy.

By default, it uses 12% of available capital per order (configurable via `CAPITAL_USAGE_PERCENT`). It can use leverage (1 by default = no leverage; for example, if your account has 100$ and you set leverage to 2, it will apply 2x leverage and use 12% of the leveraged amount ($200 * 0.12 = $24) per order.

The three core components are:
1.  **Data Collector (`gather_lighter_data.py`)**: Connects to the Lighter DEX websocket to stream real-time order book (10 levels deep) and trade data, saving it to highly compressed **Parquet** files (ZSTD).
2.  **Parameter Calculator (`calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py`)**: Implements the Avellaneda-Stoikov model to calculate optimal bid/ask spreads and reservation prices based on the collected data. It uses GARCH(1,1) for daily volatility estimation and performs grid-search optimization for time horizons.
3.  **Market Maker (`market_maker_v2.py`)**: Executes the market making strategy by placing and managing orders on the Lighter exchange, using the parameters generated by the calculator.

The entire system is orchestrated using Docker Compose, making it easy to run and manage.

Important Tips:
- Use on a dedicated account or sub-account. The bot uses 12% of available capital per order by default, and reinvests profits (compound interest).
- You don't need to have the `.env` file to run the data collector service.
- Run first the data collector service only for some time, by editing the `docker-compose.yml` (comment out the market maker service).
- To get your `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, you can go to\
   `https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/api/v1/accountsByL1Address?l1_address=0xcEd...` where `0xcEd...` is your L1 (EVM) wallet address (Metamask, Rabby, Ledger, ...).
- Freshly coded, probably some bugs, only run with small amount of funds.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.10+
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation

Before running the bot, you need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1.  **Create `.env` file:** Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. See `.env.example` for a template.

    ```env
    # Lighter Exchange Credentials
    API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_api_key_private_key>
    ACCOUNT_INDEX=<your_account_index>
    API_KEY_INDEX=<your_api_key_index>

    # Market Maker Behavior
    MARKET_SYMBOL=PAXG
    ```

2.  **Configure Tickers (`config.json`):**
    Edit `config.json` to specify which markets to track and global model parameters.
    ```json
    {
        "CRYPTO_TICKERS": ["ETH", "PAXG"],
        "GAMMA": 0.5
    }
    ```
    *   `CRYPTO_TICKERS`: List of symbols to collect data for.
    *   `GAMMA`: Fixed dimensionless risk aversion parameter (e.g., 0.5). If omitted, the calculator will attempt to optimize it via backtesting.

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   `API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, `API_KEY_INDEX`: Your Lighter exchange credentials.
    *   `MARKET_SYMBOL`: The market to trade on (e.g., PAXG, BTC, ETH). Defaults to `PAXG`.
    *   `CLOSE_LONG_ON_STARTUP`: (true/false) If true, the bot will attempt to close any existing long position in the specified market on startup. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `REQUIRE_PARAMS`: (true/false) If true, the market maker will *not* place any orders until valid Avellaneda parameters are calculated. If false, it will use a static fallback spread. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `RESTART_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: The market maker service will automatically restart after this many minutes. This helps in reloading parameters and preventing potential memory leaks. Defaults to `5`.
    *   `LEVERAGE`: The amount of leverage to use (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 8). This value multiplies your available capital, allowing for larger position sizes. Defaults to `1` (no leverage). Set to `2` for 2x leverage, `5` for 5x leverage, etc.
    *   `MARGIN_MODE`: The margin mode to use, either `cross` or `isolated`. This is also configured in `docker-compose.yml`. Defaults to `cross`.
    *   `FLIP`: (true/false) If true, the bot will adopt a short-biased strategy, selling first and then buying back. If false, it will follow a long-biased strategy, buying first and then selling. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `CAPITAL_USAGE_PERCENT`: (decimal) The percentage of available capital to use per order. Set in the code as `0.12` (12%). This controls position sizing - with 12%, each order uses that fraction of your available leveraged capital. Lower values = smaller positions, higher values = larger positions.

You can obtain the API credentials from the Lighter exchange.

### Running the Bot

Start all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

By default, only the data collector service runs. The parameter calculator and market maker services are commented out for safety:
*   `lighter-data-collector`: Gathers real-time market data (active by default).
*   `parameter-calculator`: Calculates optimal spreads and reservation prices (commented out - requires data collection first).
*   `market-maker`: Executes the trading strategy (commented out - requires parameters and user configuration).

### Stopping the Bot

To stop all services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## How it Works

### 1. Data Collection

The `gather_lighter_data.py` script connects to the Lighter DEX websocket and subscribes to the order book and trade channels for the configured markets (e.g., 'ETH', 'PAXG'). It captures **10 levels of order book depth** and saves this data to efficient, ZSTD-compressed **Parquet** files in the `lighter_data` directory. It handles deduplication and gap detection automatically.

### 2. Parameter Calculation

The `calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py` script runs periodically (e.g., every minute or 10 minutes). It loads the recent high-frequency data from the Parquet files to calculate:
*   **Volatility ($\sigma$)**: Uses a **GARCH(1,1)** model on 1-second resampled mid-prices to estimate daily volatility.
*   **Order Intensity ($A, k$)**: Fits an exponential decay function to order arrival times across different spread depths.
*   **Risk Aversion ($\gamma$)**: Uses a fixed configuration value (default 0.05) or performs a grid-search backtest over multiple time horizons to find the optimal parameter.

The calculated parameters are saved to `params/avellaneda_parameters_{TICKER}.json`.

### 3. Market Making

The `market_maker_v2.py` script reads the parameters from the JSON files. It connects to the Lighter exchange and places limit orders:
*   **Reservation Price ($r$)**: Adjusted from the mid-price based on current inventory, volatility, and risk aversion ($r = s - q \gamma \sigma^2 T$).
*   **Optimal Spread**: Centered around $r$ to maximize probability of profitable round-trip trades.

**Capital Management**: The bot uses a conservative approach to capital allocation. It applies the following formula for each order:
- Available Capital × (1 - Safety Margin) × Leverage × Capital Usage Percent
- Example with default settings: $100 × 0.99 × 1 × 0.12 = $11.88 per order

**⚠️ Risk Warning**: This trading software will likely lose money, even if it generates significant volume, because it isn’t competitive with professional firms. Always start with small amounts and make sure you understand the risks of automated cryptocurrency trading.
